Reading the local TV guides, renting CDs and DVDs, watching tapes or filmstrip projectors... Today, this is all a relic of the past. The largest movie libraries in the world are all digitized and transferred to online streaming services, like Netflix, HBO, or YouTube. Enhanced with AI-powered tools, these platforms can now assist us with probably the most difficult chore of all — picking a movie.

Well, you don’t have to worry about that anymore. It’s officially showtime for machine learning to demonstrate its capabilities in the world of cinema as known today. Data scientists are all set to explore our behavioral patterns and the ones of the movies to build sophisticated predictive systems for true movie fans.

A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users’ film preferences based on their past choices and behavior. It’s an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts the possible movie choices of the concerned user and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.

The basic concept behind a movie recommendation system is quite simple. In particular, there are two main elements in every recommender system: users and items. The system generates movie predictions for its users, while items are the movies themselves.

The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch. The ML algorithms for these recommendation systems use the data about this user from the system’s database. This data is used to predict the future behavior of the user concerned based on the information from the past.

Everyone loves movies irrespective of age, gender, race, color, or geographical location. We all in a way are connected to each other via this amazing medium. Yet what most interesting is the fact that how unique our choices and combinations are in terms of movie preferences. Some people like genre-specific movies be it a thriller, romance, or sci-fi, while others focus on lead actors and directors. When we take all that into account, it’s astoundingly difficult to generalize a movie and say that everyone would like it. But with all that said, it is still seen that similar movies are liked by a specific part of the society.

So here’s where we as data scientists come into play and extract the juice out of all the behavioral patterns of not only the audience but also from the movies themselves. So without further ado let’s jump right into the basics of a recommendation system.
